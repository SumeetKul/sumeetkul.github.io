<h4> Famelab </h4>

<br><br>
<b> Famelab</b>, 'The world's biggest Science Communication competition' challenges participants to Communicate Science in 3 minutes without using any visual aids. My talk, titled <i> Cosmic Fireworks, </i> explained one of the latest discoveries in my field: how two neutron stars collide in a \textit{Kilonova} explosion, using a pair of balloons filled with confetti. Winning the 3rd prize here gave me a chance to represent India at the Cheltenham Science Festival. Check out the story in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/first-fame-lab-contest-unites-fine-arts-science/articleshow/57300934.cms" target="_blank"><i> The Times of India </i></a></p>

<h4> EURAXESS Science Slam </h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">

<br><br>
   Organized by <a href="https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EURAXESS</a>, <i> the science slam is a scientific talk where researchers compete to present their work in front of a non-expert audience. The slam is a way to show the engaging and fascinating side of research to the wider public. </i> To qualify for the science slam, I wrote, directed, composed music for and starred in a short 5-minute video on observing sources of gravitational waves like a collision of neutron stars, using optical telescopes. The final round took me on stage (again, in my favorite Einstein Tee!) for a live 10-minute slam on the same topic. Watch it here:

<h4> Public Talks </h4>

<ul>
<li> The British Council's <i>Cafe Scientifique</i>: I spoke about 'The Rise of Artificial Intelligence in Astronomy' at the British Library, Pune to an audience of around 60. Cafe Scientifique provides a unique forum for the discussion of scientific issues in a way that is much more relaxed, informal and accessible than a public lecture. (January 5, 2018) </li>
</ul>

<h4> Other Activities </h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li> I am a co-editor of the <a href="https://humansofligo.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humans of LIGO</a> blog, an initiative which celebrates individuals in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, comprising of more than 1300 scientists and engineers from over 100 institutions and 18 countries worldwide.</li>
<li> Halloween spooky physics night: I dress up in nerdy costumes, serve liquid nitrogen candy and conduct physics demos like `the pumpkin drop' at this family-friendly event attended by over 300 locals every year at the UM Department of Physics and Astronomy.</li>
</ul>
