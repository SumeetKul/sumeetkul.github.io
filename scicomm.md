<h4> Famelab </h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">
{% include YouTubePlayer.html id="FKywLiYXG-s" %}
<br><br>
<b> Famelab</b>, 'The world's biggest Science Communication competition' challenges participants to Communicate Science in 3 minutes without using any visual aids. My talk, titled <i> Cosmic Fireworks, </i> explained one of the latest discoveries in my field: how two neutron stars collide in a \textit{Kilonova} explosion, using a pair of balloons filled with confetti. Winning the 3rd prize here gave me a chance to represent India at the Cheltenham Science Festival. Check out the story in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/first-fame-lab-contest-unites-fine-arts-science/articleshow/57300934.cms" target="_blank"><i> The Times of India </i></a></p>

<h4> EURAXESS Science Slam </h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">

<br><br>
   Organized by <a href="https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EURAXESS</a>, <i> the science slam is a scientific talk where researchers compete to present their work in front of a non-expert audience. The slam is a way to show the engaging and fascinating side of research to the wider public. </i> To qualify for the science slam, I wrote, directed, composed music for and starred in a short 5-minute video on observing sources of gravitational waves like a collision of neutron stars, using optical telescopes. The final round took me on stage (again, in my favorite Einstein Tee!) for a live 10-minute slam on the same topic. Watch it here:

<h2 id="content">Oxford Science Cafe</h2>

<p>Between 2019-2023, I co-organized the Oxford Science Cafe: monthly public talks and conversations about science for the local community in Oxford, the only event of its kind in north Mississippi. Besides emceeing for the main event, I identify and invite potential speakers, help secure funding and publicize it.

<h2> Ssippin' Science </h2>

<p>Ssippin' Science is a podcast where I pick up quotes and talking points from the Oxford Science Cafe talks, and add my narrative to craft concise stories for a science-y soundbite.</p> <br>
