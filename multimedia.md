        <p>Between 2024-25, I wrote and directed two videos for the science YouTube channel <i>Veritasium</i>, created by Dr. Derek Muller. Both videos have gained 9M+ views on YouTube. I worked with a talented team of researchers, animators, and video editors to demystify two complex areas of science in an engaging and entertaining manner.

        The first video deciphered QR codes, the intriguing checkerboard patterns that have taken over the world. Learn how QR codes work here, alongside the fascinating history behind their development: </p>

        <p>I was selected as a 2025 Fellow at the Jackson Wild Media Lab. Over the course of five action-packed days, I trained in operating cinematic cameras, story-boarding, and video editing using Adobe Premiere. Within this short timeline, we also produced a 5-minute film for a client---a researcher who studies plankton in the alpine lakes of the Teton mountains in Wyoming. </p>

        <p>Ssippin' Science was a podcast that I started during the COVID-19 pandemic. I picked up quotes and talking points shared in the Oxford Science Cafe and add my own narrative to condense the hour-long public talks into 15-minute science soundbites. When the pandemic forced the cafe online, we hosted talks featuring vaccine development and the kind of science people could enjoy from the safety of their homes, for instance, stargazing. I also conducted interviews with past speakers of the science cafe on its 10-year anniversary. </p> <br>

<!-- <p>I co-organize the Oxford Science Cafe: monthly public talks and conversations about science for the local community in Oxford, the only event of its kind in north Mississippi. Besides emceeing for the main event, I identify and invite potential speakers, help secure funding and publicize it.
